  'Shri Nimbargi Maharaj': `
Birth: April 9, 1789 AD (Shake 1712) in Solapur
Initiation (Anugrah): Between 1809-1814
Passing (Niryaan): March 29, 1885 AD (Chaitra Sh 12, Shake 1807)

Shri Narayanrao Bhausaheb, widely known as Shri Nimbargi Maharaj, is revered as the foundational saint of the Nimbargi Sampradaya. Often called a "Spiritual Bhagirath," he is credited with reviving a spiritual tradition that had been dormant for centuries, much like King Bhagirath brought the celestial Ganga river to earth.

Born into a Virasaiva family in Nimbargi, a village in Karnataka, his life took a pivotal turn at the age of 25. After being reprimanded by his father for his enthusiastic participation in the Holi festival, a remorseful Narayanrao traveled to Pandharpur. There, he prayed fervently to Lord Vitthal for three days. On the third day, the Lord appeared in his dream, directing him to Siddhagiri to find his spiritual master.

Following the divine guidance, he met the Yogi Shri Muppinmuni at a cave in Siddhagiri, who initiated him with the Divine Name and instructed him in meditation. Although Narayanrao was initially distracted by family life for six years, a surprise visit from his Guru reignited his commitment. He then changed his profession from a dyer to a shepherd to dedicate more time to his spiritual practice. For 36 years, he engaged in intense meditation, eventually attaining the pinnacle of spiritual realization and enjoying a profound connection with the Atman (the Self).

For the last 28 years of his life, Shri Nimbargi Maharaj guided deserving disciples and conducted discourses on the Dasabodha. His core teaching was to dedicate worldly life to the Self through constant meditation. He taught that everything is controlled by the will of the Self and that by deserving Its grace, one can visualize Its divine light. His teachings were later compiled in a volume called "Bodh-Sudha" (The Nectar of Illumination). His spiritual lineage continued through prominent disciples, including Raghunathpriya Sadhu Maharaj, who in turn guided Shri Bhausahib Maharaj of Umadi. Shri Nimbargi Maharaj passed away at the age of 95, and his Samadhi in Nimbargi remains a sacred site for followers.

  'Shri Amburao Maharaj': `
Birth: September 21, 1857 (Bhadrapad Sh 9, Shake 1779) in Jigjivani
Initiation (Anugrah): April 1892 (Chaitra Sh 15, Shake 1814)
Passing (Niryaan): December 22, 1933 (Poush Sh 6, Shake 1855)

Shri Amburao Maharaj, affectionately known as Baba, was a premier disciple of Shri Bhausaheb Maharaj and a spiritual brother to Shri Gurudev Ranade. His life is a testament to faith and penance, and he played a crucial role in carrying forward the spiritual lineage of the Nimbargi Sampradaya.

Born into a poor Smarth Brahmin family in Jigjivani, Baba faced immense hardship from a young age, including the early loss of his parents and wife. His spiritual journey began unexpectedly when his sister encouraged him to attend a festival at Nimbargi, where he met Shri Bhausaheb Maharaj and was initiated, almost against his will. Despite his initial reluctance, Baba dedicated himself to meditation with such intensity that he experienced profound visions of divine light within three months.

He was instrumental in building the Ashram and the Samadhi of Shri Nimbargi Maharaj at Inchgiri, managing its affairs until his Master's passing in 1914. Afterward, despite disputes over leadership, Shri Amburao stood as a protector of the true spiritual path taught in the Sampradaya. In 1915, following a clear mandate from his Master in a dream, he began initiating his own disciples.

Shri Amburao Maharaj was a source of great moral and spiritual support for Gurudev Ranade, whom he considered his twin. He conducted extensive spiritual tours, spreading devotion and clearing the pathway to God for thousands of followers. His Samadhi is located beside his guru's at Inchgiri.

  'Shri Bhausaheb Maharaj': `
Birth: 1843 (Chaitra Sh 9, Ramnavami, Shake 1765) in Umadi
Initiation (Anugrah): 1858
Passing (Niryaan): January 29, 1914 (Magh, Sh 3, Shake 1835)

Shri Venkatesh Khanderao Deshpande, widely known as Shri Bhausahib Maharaj, was a prominent saint of the Nimbargi Sampradaya and a foremost disciple of Shri Nimbargi Maharaj. Born into a well-to-do family in Umadi, Maharashtra, he showed deep devotion from a young age, particularly to Lord Hanuman.

At the age of 14, he was introduced to Shri Nimbargi Maharaj by Shri Raghunath Priya Maharaj and was initiated into the spiritual path. For the next 28 years, he balanced his worldly duties with intense daily meditation, eventually achieving "Advaita Siddhi," the highest state of self-realization. After his Master's passing in 1885, he redoubled his spiritual efforts and took on the responsibility of spreading devotion.

He established a spiritual center at Inchgiri, which became a hub of spiritual activity. From there, he traveled extensively on horseback across Karnataka and Maharashtra, guiding countless seekers. For 18 years, he conducted the "Shravan Sadhan Saptaha," a weekly spiritual gathering at Umadi that drew many disciples for long meditation sessions.

Shri Bhausahib Maharaj's teachings are encapsulated in a few profound aphorisms, emphasizing the remembrance of the Divine Name as reality and forgetfulness as illusion. He taught his disciples to live with resolute endurance (Dhir), magnanimity (Udar), and a considerate outlook (Gambhir). He passed away at the age of 71, leaving a rich spiritual legacy continued by his prominent disciples, including Shri Amburao Maharaj and Shri Gurudev R. D. Ranade.

  'Shri Gurudev Ranade': `
Birth: July 3, 1886, in Jamkhandi
Initiation (Anugrah): 1901 (Kartik Sh 14, Vaikuntha Chaturdashi)
Passing (Niryaan): June 6, 1957 (Jeshth Sh 10, Gangadashami)

Sri Gurudev Dr. Ramchandra Dattatreya Ranade was a rare combination of a saint, philosopher, and scholar, whose life was a brilliant example of spiritual devotion and intellectual rigor. Born in Jamkhandi, he was raised in a devout household and received his spiritual initiation with the Divine Name from Sadguru Shri Bhausahib Maharaj in 1901.

While dedicated to his spiritual practices, Dr. Ranade also excelled academically, earning scholarships and gold medals throughout his education. He sought an intellectual foundation for his spiritual experiences, which led him to a deep study of both Eastern and Western philosophy. He served as a Professor of Philosophy at Fergusson College and later at Allahabad University, where he eventually became Head of the Philosophy Department, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and finally, Vice-Chancellor.

Severe illnesses and personal tragedies only deepened his spiritual resolve and granted him profound experiences of divine bliss. In 1922, following a dream-vision, he established a modest ashram in Nimbal, which has since grown into a significant spiritual center.

In 1920, at the height of his meditation, Gurudev received the divine mandate to initiate others. He began this work in 1936 after the passing of his spiritual brother, Shri Amburao Maharaj. He blessed thousands of seekers from all walks of life. His first major publication, "A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy" (1926), earned him international acclaim. His ultimate goal was to create a comprehensive work on the "Pathway to God," bridging global philosophies, though this remained unfinished upon his passing. His final message to his disciples was a call to attain "Himalayan heights" through devotion and meditation.
