  'Shri Nimbargi Maharaj': 
  `Janma: April 9, 1789; Solapur (raised at Devar Nimbargi, Karnataka); Shake 1712
Anugrah: c. 1809–1814 at Siddhagiri by Yogi Muppinmuni of the Kadasiddha lineage
Niryaan: March 29, 1885; Chaitra Sh 12, Shake 1807

Sadguru Shri Narayanrao Bhausahib, revered as Nimbargi Maharaj, is regarded as the originator of the Nimbargi Sampradaya. He is remembered as a Spiritual Bhagirath who, through decades of intense meditation, revived the hidden current of inner realization in this region, opening the path for countless seekers who followed.

Born in Solapur and brought up in the village of Nimbargi (Bijapur district), he belonged to a Lingayat (Neelawani sub-caste) family with the surname Misalkar. In his youth, a moment of shame after being reprimanded by his father during the Holi festival drove him to Pandharpur. There, after three days of fervent prayer, Lord Vitthal appeared in his dream and directed him to Siddhagiri. At the temple of Shri Kadsiddheshwar, he encountered Yogi Muppinmuni, who initiated him with the Divine Name and instructed him to meditate sincerely.

Though he initially neglected the practice, a later visit by his Guru reignited his resolve. Renouncing his trade as a dyer, he became a shepherd—an occupation that allowed long hours of solitude. For thirty-six years he immersed himself in Naam Sadhana, meditating ceaselessly under trees and in fields, progressing stage by stage until he attained profound realization and union with the Atman.

In the last twenty-eight years of his life, Nimbargi Maharaj emerged as a Sadguru, guiding seekers with mature wisdom born of direct experience. He interpreted Dasbodh of Samarth Ramdas, and his own teachings were later compiled as Bodh-Sudha (The Nectar of Illumination). He was known for initiating only those truly deserving and urged disciples to dedicate both worldly and spiritual life to the Self, emphasizing that everything is governed by the Divine Will and that meditation alone makes life complete.

Among his foremost disciples was Raghunathpriya Sadhu Maharaj, who later initiated Shri Bhausahib Maharaj of Umdi, thus continuing the living lineage that flowed to Amburao Maharaj and Gurudev Dr. R. D. Ranade.

Shri Nimbargi Maharaj taught that even the slightest glimpse of the Self is sufficient for liberation:
“If you get even a glimpse of the Spiritual Ensign, you would never be born again.”

His message was one of constant soulful meditation, surrender, and the vision of inner Light. Gurudev Ranade likened him to the Bakula tree, whose hidden flowers spread fragrance across Karnataka. He left his body on 29 March 1885 at the age of 95. His Samadhi at Devar Nimbargi remains a sacred pilgrimage site, where devotees continue to feel the living presence of the founder of the Sampradaya.`,

  'Shri Amburao Maharaj': 
  `Janma: Jigjivani, Sept 21, 1857; Monday, Bhadrapad Sh 9, Shake 1779
Anugrah: April 1892; Chaitra Sh 15, Shake 1814; 2 p.m. in Siddheshwar Temple
Niryaan: Dec 22, 1933; Friday, Poush Sh 6, Shake 1855

Sadguru Shri Amburao Maharaj, affectionately called Baba, was a direct disciple of H. H. Sadguru Shri Bhausahib Maharaj of Umadi and the senior spiritual brother of Gurudev Dr. R. D. Ranade. His life reflected complete faith, devotion, and penance, and he played a vital role in carrying forward the Nimbargi Sampradaya after the passing of his Guru.

Born in 1857 in Jigjivani village of Bijapur district to a poor Smarth Brahmin family, Amburao Maharaj faced many hardships. He lost his parents at an early age, endured severe poverty, and later also faced the untimely loss of his wife and daughter. In the midst of these struggles, a turning point came when he visited the Bhimraya festival at Nimbargi. There, he encountered Shri Bhausahib Maharaj, who initiated him into the Divine Name almost against his will.

Though initially hesitant, Amburao Maharaj devoted himself wholeheartedly to the discipline given by his Guru. He meditated day and night with unwavering focus, and soon began experiencing profound inner light and bliss. With his Master’s grace, he advanced steadily on the path, eventually receiving the authority to initiate aspirants.

One of his major contributions was building and managing the Ashram and the Samadhi of Shri Bhausahib Maharaj at Inchgiri, especially after his Guru’s passing in 1914. At a time when disputes arose regarding succession within the Sampradaya, Baba stood firm in preserving the true spiritual path. Following a dream-vision in 1915, he began initiating disciples, carrying forward his Guru’s mission with dedication.

Sadguru Amburao Maharaj guided many aspirants and attracted thousands of devotees across regions. He was a source of constant support—both moral and spiritual—to Gurudev Dr. R. D. Ranade, considering him his spiritual twin. In 1927, he established an independent Math at Inchgiri, while continuing to honor his Guru’s memory.

He often compared spiritual practice to a blind man twisting jute into rope—one must keep meditating without worrying about progress or results, trusting fully in the Master’s grace. His life became a shining example of how complete surrender to the Guru transforms an ordinary seeker into a Sadguru.

Sadguru Shri Amburao Maharaj left his mortal body on 22 December 1933 at Bijapur. His Samadhi lies beside that of Shri Bhausahib Maharaj at Inchgiri, and the Math he built continues to serve as a center of devotion and guidance. His contribution ensured that the flame of the Nimbargi Sampradaya remained alive and accessible for future generations.`,

  'Shri Bhausaheb Maharaj': 
  `Janma: Umadi, 1843; Chaitra Sh 9, Ramnavami, Shake 1765
Anugrah: 1858
Niryaan: Jan 29, 1914; Thursday, Magh Sh 3, Shake 1835

Sadguru Shri Venkatesh Khanderao Deshpande, popularly known as Sadguru Shri Bhausahib Maharaj (Umadikar), was a revered saint of the Nimbargi Sampradaya and the foremost disciple of Sadguru Shri Nimbargi Maharaj. He carried forward the tradition of meditation on the Divine Name (Nama), establishing Inchgiri as a spiritual center and initiating many seekers on the path of devotion and self-realization.

Born in 1843 at Umadi in Maharashtra, Bhausahib belonged to a respected Deshpande family. From a young age, he displayed deep devotion, particularly to Lord Hanuman, and would worship regularly at the local Balbheem temple. It was Shri Raghunathpriya Maharaj, a disciple of Nimbargi Maharaj, who guided him towards the Nimbargi tradition. At the age of 14, he received initiation from Shri Nimbargi Maharaj and began to meditate sincerely on the Divine Name imparted by his Guru.

For nearly three decades, Bhausahib Maharaj balanced worldly responsibilities with intense meditation. His discipline and dedication gradually led him to profound spiritual experiences, culminating in the realization of Advaita Siddhi — the highest state of non-dual awareness. At his Guru’s instruction, he began initiating aspirants in 1875, and after the passing of Shri Nimbargi Maharaj in 1885, he intensified his spiritual practice with renewed zeal.

He organized Shravan Sadhan Saptahas (week-long meditation gatherings) at Umadi between 1885 and 1903, where seekers engaged deeply in Nama-smaran. Later, for 18 years, he continued his nightly meditation in a narrow two-foot space at his house, a testament to his austerity and determination.

Fulfilling his Guru’s wish, Bhausahib Maharaj built a Samadhi temple for Shri Nimbargi Maharaj and later shifted the center of the Sampradaya to Inchgiri. From there, he expanded his spiritual work, spreading devotion across Maharashtra and Karnataka, traveling frequently to Bijapur, Jamkhandi, Solapur, and surrounding regions. Inchgiri soon became a major hub of Nama-yoga and spiritual activity.

The essence of his teachings can be summarized in a few guiding principles:

Meditation on the Divine Name is the supreme spiritual reality.

Forgetting the Divine Name leads to worldly illusion.

A burning desire for self-knowledge is the source of illumination.

Dispassion is the root of true devotion.

The mind is the seat of the heart where meditation must be centered.

An aspirant should meditate with perseverance, regardless of circumstances.


Sadguru Shri Bhausahib Maharaj attained Mahasamadhi on 29th January 1914 at Inchgiri. His Samadhi lies beside that of Shri Nimbargi Maharaj, and later of Sadguru Shri Amburao Maharaj. Among his prominent disciples were Sadguru Shri Amburao Maharaj, Smt. Shivalingavva Akka, and Sadguru Shri Gurudev Ranade, who carried forward his spiritual mission. Through his life and teachings, Bhausahib Maharaj strengthened the foundations of the Nimbargi Sampradaya and left a lasting influence on generations of seekers.`,

  `Janma: Jamkhindi, July 3, 1886
Anugrah: 1901; Kartik Sh 14, Vaikuntha Chaturdashi
Niryaan: June 6, 1957; Thursday, Jeshth Sh 10, Gangadashami

Sri Gurudev Dr. Ramchandra Dattatreya Ranade was a philosopher, mystic, and spiritual teacher of the 20th century. He was born on 3rd July 1886 at Jamkhandi, then a princely state. His early education began in 1895, and in 1901 he was initiated into the Nimbargi Sampradaya by his Guru, Shri Bhausaheb Maharaj of Umadi. This initiation marked the beginning of his spiritual journey.

Dr. Ranade was a brilliant student. He secured several scholarships, stood second in matriculation, and later graduated from Deccan College, Pune. He pursued Sanskrit, Mathematics, and English, winning recognition for his academic excellence. Despite health challenges, including brain tuberculosis diagnosed in 1909, he continued his studies and completed his M.A. in Philosophy in 1914 with high distinction, receiving the Vice-Chancellor and Justice K. T. Telang Gold Medals.

He served as Professor of Philosophy at Fergusson College, Pune, and later at Allahabad University, where he became Head of the Philosophy Department, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and eventually Vice-Chancellor. In 1947, both he and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru were conferred the honorary degree of D.Litt.

Alongside his academic career, Dr. Ranade remained deeply devoted to spiritual practice. After the passing of his Guru, he spent time at Inchagiri and later settled in Nimbal in 1925, where he built a small ashram. From there, he guided many seekers, imparting the Divine Name and spiritual teachings. His writings and lectures covered the Upanishads, Bhagavad Gita, Vedanta, and the mystical traditions of Marathi, Hindi, and Kannada saints. His major work, A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy (1926), brought him international recognition.

He lived a simple and austere life, often stating that his life itself was his philosophy. Despite fragile health and personal losses, he continued his work with dedication. His teachings emphasized a balance of intellectual inquiry and spiritual experience, aiming to guide aspirants on the pathway to God.

Sri Gurudev Dr. R. D. Ranade left his mortal body on 6th June 1957 at Nimbal. His legacy continues through his writings, lectures, and the spiritual lineage he carried forward in the Nimbargi Sampradaya.
